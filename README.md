# IDSw - Infectious Disease Storage Web
## Project Description
IDSw is a web-based application designed to manage infectious disease data. It offers a range of features for storing, updating, inserting, and deleting information related to various *viral or bacterial* infectious diseases. The system includes comprehensive functionality covering disease attributes, symptoms, treatment plans, disease development simulation, diagnosis tracking, and more.
## Features
* ### Role-based Access Control
Differentiate user permissions and functionalities based on roles such as patient, doctor, and researcher, each with specific permissions and access levels.
* ### User Authentication
Secure login system for user authentication and access control.
* ### Disease Management
Store and manage information about infectious diseases including attributes such as name, symptoms, mortality rate, infectious rate, cause *(virus, bacteria)*, incubation period, development period, convalescence period, treatment plan, and symptoms.
* ### Symptom Management
Record and manage symptoms with detailed descriptions.
* ### Treatment Plan Management
Store treatment plans associated with specific diseases and diagnoses.
* ### Diagnosis Management
Track diagnoses made by *Doctors* associated with specific *Medical Records* and *Patients*.
* ### Medical Records
Store and manage patient medical records, including multiple diagnoses, each with its specific treatment plan.
* ### Graphical Disease Development Simulation
Simulate disease spread and progression based on user-defined parameters.
* ### Graphical Development Representation
Visualize disease development graphs on a person based on parameters stored in the database, such as infectious rate, incubation period, and development period.
* ### Search Functionality
Search for diseases and symptoms within the system.
## Users
* **Patients**: Can search for diseases by symptoms and name, view disease profiles, and access their medical records.
* **Doctors**: Can perform all patient actions, as well as create and modify medical records and diagnoses and delete diagnoses.
* **Researchers**: Can create/modify disease attributes, symptoms, and treatment plans. They can also create disease simulations.
